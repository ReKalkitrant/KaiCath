    <div class="poetry">
      <p><span><span>Naboth the Jezreelite had a vineyard in Jezreel<br />
            next to the palace of Ahab, king of Samaria.<br />
            Ahab said to Naboth, “Give me your vineyard to be my vegetable garden,<br />
            since it is close by, next to my house.<br />
            I will give you a better vineyard in exchange, or,<br />
            if you prefer, I will give you its value in money.”<br />
            Naboth answered him, “The LORD forbid<br />
            that I should give you my ancestral heritage.”<br />
            Ahab went home disturbed and angry at the answer<br />
            Naboth the Jezreelite had made to him:<br />
            “I will not give you my ancestral heritage.”<br />
            Lying down on his bed, he turned away from food and would not eat.<br />
            <br /> <button onclick="ScrollBy100 ()">Scroll the document vertically by 100 pixels!</button> <br />
            His wife Jezebel came to him and said to him,<br />
            “Why are you so angry that you will not eat?”<br />
            He answered her, “Because I spoke to Naboth the Jezreelite<br />
            and said to him, ‘Sell me your vineyard, or,<br />
            if you prefer, I will give you a vineyard in exchange.’<br />
            But he refused to let me have his vineyard.”<br />
            His wife Jezebel said to him,<br />
            “A fine ruler over Israel you are indeed!<br />
            Get up.<br />
            Eat and be cheerful.<br />
            I will obtain the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite for you.”<br />
            <br />
            So she wrote letters in Ahab’s name and,<br />
            having sealed them with his seal,<br />
            sent them to the elders and to the nobles<br />
            who lived in the same city with Naboth.<br />
            This is what she wrote in the letters:<br />
            “Proclaim a fast and set Naboth at the head of the people.<br />
            Next, get two scoundrels to face him<br />
            and accuse him of having cursed God and king.<br />
            Then take him out and stone him to death.”<br />
            His fellow citizens—the elders and nobles who dwelt in his city—<br />
            did as Jezebel had ordered them in writing,<br />
            through the letters she had sent them.<br />
            They proclaimed a fast and placed Naboth at the head of the people.<br />
            Two scoundrels came in and confronted him with the accusation,<br />
            “Naboth has cursed God and king.”<br />
            And they led him out of the city and stoned him to death.<br />
            Then they sent the information to Jezebel<br />
            that Naboth had been stoned to death.<br />
            <br />
            When Jezebel learned that Naboth had been stoned to death,<br />
            she said to Ahab,<br />
            “Go on, take possession of the vineyard<br />
            of Naboth the Jezreelite that he refused to sell you,<br />
            because Naboth is not alive, but dead.”<br />
            On hearing that Naboth was dead, Ahab started off on his way<br />
            down to the vineyard of Naboth the Jezreelite,<br />
            to take possession of it.</span></span><br />

    <div class="poetry">
      <p><span><span>R. (2b) <strong>Lord, listen to my groaning.</strong><br />
            Hearken to my words, O LORD,<br />
            attend to my sighing.<br />
            Heed my call for help,<br />
            my king and my God!<br />
            R. <strong>Lord, listen to my groaning.</strong><br />
            At dawn I bring my plea expectantly before you.<br />
            For you, O God, delight not in wickedness;<br />
            no evil man remains with you;<br />
            the arrogant may not stand in your sight.<br />
            R. <strong>Lord, listen to my groaning.</strong><br />
            You hate all evildoers.<br />
            You destroy all who speak falsehood;<br />
            The bloodthirsty and the deceitful<br />
            the LORD abhors.<br />
            R. <strong>Lord, listen to my groaning.</strong></span></span></p>

    <div class="poetry">
      <p><span><span>R. <strong>Alleluia, alleluia.</strong><br />

    <h4>Gospel <a href="https://bible.usccb.org/bible/matthew/5?38 ">Mt 5:38-42</a></h4>
    <div class="poetry">
      <p><span><span>Jesus said to his disciples:<br />
            “You have heard that it was said,<br />
            <em>An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.</em><br />
            But I say to you, offer no resistance to one who is evil.<br />
            When someone strikes you on your right cheek,<br />
            turn the other one to him as well.<br />
            If anyone wants to go to law with you over your tunic,<br />
            hand him your cloak as well.<br />
            Should anyone press you into service for one mile,<br />
            go with him for two miles.<br />
            Give to the one who asks of you,<br />
            and do not turn your back on one who wants to borrow.”</span></span></p>
