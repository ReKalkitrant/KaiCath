                Lord Jesus Christ,<br>
                I approach your banquet table
                in fear and trembling,<br>
                for I am a sinner,<br>
                and dare not rely on my own worth,<br>
                but only on your goodness and mercy.<br>
                I am defiled by many sins in body and soul,<br>
                and by my unguarded thoughts and words.<br>
                Gracious God of majesty and awe,<br>
                I seek your protection,<br>
                I look for your healing.<br>
                Poor troubled sinner that I am,<br>
                I appeal to you, the fountain of all mercy.<br>
                I cannot bear your judgment,<br>
                but I trust in your salvation.<br>
                Lord, I show my wounds to you
                and uncover my shame before you.<br>
                I know my sins are many and great,<br>
                and they fill me with fear,<br>
                but I hope in your mercies,<br>
                for they cannot be numbered.<br>
                Lord Jesus Christ, eternal king, God and man,<br>
                crucified for mankind,<br>
                look upon me with mercy and hear my prayer,<br>
                for I trust in you.<br>
                Have mercy on me,<br>
                full of sorrow and sin,<br>
                for the depth of your compassion never ends.<br>
                Praise to you, saving sacrfice,<br>
                offered on the wood of the cross for me and for all mankind.<br>
                Praise to the noble and precious blood,<br>
                flowing from the wounds of the my crucified Lord Jesus Christ
                and washing away the sins of the whole world.<br>
                Remember, Lord your creature,<br>
                whom you have redeemed with your blood;<br>
                I repent my sins,<br>
                and I long to put right what I have done.
                Merciful Father, take away all my offenses and sins;<br>
                purify me in body and soul,<br>
                and make me worthy to taste the holy of holies.<br>
                May your body and blood,<br>
                which I intend to receive, although I am unworthy,<br>
                be for me the remission of my sins,<br>
                the washing away of my guilt,<br>
                the end of my evil thoughts,<br>
                and the rebirth of my better instincts.<br>
                May it incite me to do the works pleasing to you
                and profitable to my health in body and soul,<br>
                and be a firm defense against the wiles of my enemies. <br>Amen.<br><br><br>z
